**As evident by my title: I am a fan of recursion. Here is why:**
1. **I love tracing every call!** <!--Bold-->
   - Despite that being tedious
     - It is actually a very useful tool.
3. *I love messing up base cases!* <!--Italic-->
   - One of the most common errors is stack overflow
      - But that gave us the name of the website we know and love 🫀 ***Stack Overflow!*** <!--Both-->

>I am being sarcastic <!--Adding Quotes-->
